# Algorithms for Cyber Defense

**Special Issue Announcement:** We invite contributions to the *Special Issue on "Algorithms for Cyber Defense: From Cryptography to Behavioral Analysis"* published in the journal [Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms). This Special Issue explores the **full spectrum of algorithms in modern cyber defense**, including (but not limited to):
- Encryption & decryption methods  
- Authentication schemes & secure key exchange  
- Anomaly & intrusion detection  
- Static analysis & reverse engineering of malicious code  
- Adversarial machine learning  
- Security-aware AI models  

The goal is to bridge **formal algorithm design** with **practical implementations**, covering everything from embedded devices to large-scale critical infrastructure.  

**Deadline for manuscript submissions:** **31 July 2026**

In addition to original research articles, review papers are also welcome in this Special Issue, and in fact, they are highly encouraged. The academic field of cyber security is still in its infancy, only just beginning to open its eyes. The field is so young that authors often find themselves compelled to step outside traditional academic norms, citing online resources and web-links instead of well-established literature (something that, from a classical perspective, can be considered almost a blasphemy). This situation highlights the crucial importance of review articles: they not only provide structure and clarity in a rapidly evolving academic domain but are also bound to become highly cited references in the future.

## Message from the Editor

Dear Colleagues,

The aim of this Special Issue is to explore the full spectrum of algorithms used in modern cyber defense. We welcome both theoretical and applied contributions in areas such as encryption and decryption methods, authentication schemes, secure key exchange, anomaly detection, static analysis, intrusion detection, reverse engineering of malicious code, adversarial learning, and security-aware AI models. We encourage submissions that bridge formal algorithm design with practical implementations in security-critical systems, ranging from embedded devices to large-scale infrastructure. This Issue serves as a platform for engineers, data scientists, and security researchers to share breakthroughs that redefine digital defense.

Dr. Paul A. Gagniuc
